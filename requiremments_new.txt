Rwanda Development Board (RDB) is the government department that integrates all government agencies responsible for the attraction,
retention and facilitation of investments in the national economy.
 Rwanda Development Board. Company type. Parastatal.

So, people both natives and other form different regions when they have an idea of a particular project that
must help Rwanda in population development includind infrastructures, healthcare, economic, political and or social affears
they must approach RDB and convince the administration how their project will be more useful (this who do this most of the times
 are seeking for government support manily in a financial way) so that the one succeed will be funded in order to implement it.

In order this to happen the project idea's owner will start from the local leaders who are to support his/her idea and help him/her
proceed with the super leadership positions. However, this process is exhausting because it takes a long period of processes where
a person must run from the villager local leader, cell, sector, district, province till to the ministry level and this requires a lot of money for
spenditures, time and sometimes some people may still project owner idea.

So, I want to make the automated system where the project owner (the person who has a project idea) will go into the system and set the project‚ÅØ idea, the location
it must be implemented, and the system therefore track the amount of money it must take according to the infrastructures available at that particular location, the level of development,
the population it will affect. Then the system will late projects accordingly where the most important (the project which mostly needed) will be first project to be funded (where
the ones in charge will go to the system and and see the listed project ideas filtered from their importance)and fund them accordingly
